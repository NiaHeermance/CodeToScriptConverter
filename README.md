## CodeToScriptConverter

**CodeToScriptConverter** allows easy creation of PDF Scripts from Ren'Py game ``rpy`` files. When cloning
this repository, create a folder ``Files`` inside ``Config``, and copy and fill out the ``Templates`` files
into this directory to work with your chosen ``Ren'Py`` game.

This repository requires PDFLaTeX to be installed with the enumitem and geometry packages.

For help converting ``rpyc`` files into ``rpy`` files, use [rpatool](https://github.com/shizmob/rpatool).
